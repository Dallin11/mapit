## Getting Started
Clone the repo

git clone url

npm install both at the root and inside app

npm install 

cd app 

npm install

You will run npm start inside app where you should already be. We used the bebop-2 connecting to it via wifi. Most drones should work with this app. Connect to your drone using the Connect button on the fly page, then use the controller to control the drone.

## Using The App

After navigating to the Fly page and connecting to your drone

You can use the controller to depart, land, and move your drone. the height is initially set to 50% of max height. Before immersing yourself test each button to see how it impacts your personal drone.
